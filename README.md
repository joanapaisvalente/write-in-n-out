## Why did I do this?
I was just really bored one day scrolling and saw an animation for this write in and out text, I looked at it and was like 'this is never gonna work', and guess what? I was right.

This made me really annoyed for some reason so I tried to make it work and here you have it.

Btw I looked at a code pen (https://codepen.io/theking04123/pen/MWKVXxy) for inspiration. At first, I just wanted to make it work with a simple phrase (as seen on the code pen) and improve a bit, but then I thought that it would be more fun if the phrase changed, and that's what we have now folks.

Also, I thought that since I have never had the need to create a light and dark mode, this would be the perfect opportunity to do so. Idk, I'm just having a bit of fun.

## But how can I run this?
On VSCode, install Live Server extension. After you cloned this just click Go Live on the bottom right corner.
